                <p class="text-white">Three guys met at a hackathon with a challenge to build something that could benefit society. They decided to create a platform that could facilitate donations and help people in need. After brainstorming different ideas, they came up with the concept of a website where users could donate and receive items such as textbooks, clothes, and other necessities. With their technical skills, they worked hard to bring their idea to life and created a user-friendly platform that would make donating and receiving items easier and more accessible. Through their dedication and hard work, they hope to create a positive impact on society and help those who are less fortunate.</p>
                <p class="text-white">Despite having limited experience and skills in web development, the three guys were determined to build a platform that could benefit society. They were all freshmen in their respective colleges, namely Hunter, BMCC, and LaGuardia Community College, and were taking basic programming courses. Even though their backgrounds and skills were different, they all shared a common interest in making a positive impact on their community. They agreed to participate in a hackathon with the aim of creating a project that would address this interest, and this was where they came up with the idea of building a website for donations. Despite the lack of time and knowledge in backend technology, the trio worked tirelessly to develop the website as best they could. They knew that their efforts may not have been enough, but they remained hopeful that their project could still make a difference.</p>
                <p class="text-white">The website that these three guys built may not be perfect, but they put their heart and soul into making it as functional and user-friendly as possible. They hope that people will use it and find it helpful in donating and receiving donations for their community. The team believes that this website can create a positive impact on society and contribute to making the world a better place. They are eager to receive feedback from the users on how to improve the website further. So, if you are interested in donating or receiving donations, scroll down and check out their website. Who knows, maybe you will find something that you have been looking for!</p>

            <h2 class="text-white">Why you should donate?</h2>
            <p class="text-white">There are many reasons why everyone should donate to a cause they care about. Firstly, donating helps make a positive impact on society and can bring about change for the better. Whether it's supporting a charity, a cause, or an individual in need, donating can make a significant difference in someone's life. Additionally, giving back to the community through donations can give a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction, knowing that you have helped others in need. Furthermore, donating can also inspire others to do the same, creating a ripple effect of kindness and generosity. By donating, you not only help those in need but also contribute to a better and more compassionate society.</p>
